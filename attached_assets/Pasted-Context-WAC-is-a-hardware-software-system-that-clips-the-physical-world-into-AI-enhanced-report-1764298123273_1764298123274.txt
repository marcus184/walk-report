Context

WAC is a hardware + software system that “clips” the physical world into AI-enhanced reports. The goal is to cut down administrative time while massively increasing observability, progress tracking, and documentation quality.

The current app (screenshot provided) has three main zones:

Walk Data (left): a file browser of images (thumbnails + filename + size + date).

PDF Builder (right): a big drop zone where users drag images to add to a PDF, with buttons to clear and generate the PDF.

Created PDFs (bottom): list of already generated PDFs.

Functionality must stay the same or get better, but the UI/UX should be completely re-imagined.

Overall design direction

Make it feel like a MAC / Palantir-style operations console: minimal, high signal, “matte tactical” rather than playful.

Dark theme using zinc / matte black surfaces with vibrant yellow-orange accents.

Treat this like a serious tool that might be used by field engineers, safety teams, and operations leaders.

The app should feel immersive (full-bleed layout, good use of space, clear hierarchy) and intuitive (obvious affordances, no clutter).

Use this technology stack:

React + TypeScript

Tailwind CSS for styling

Modern, composable component structure

Color, typography, and visual language

Implement a small design system:

Backgrounds

App shell: very dark zinc/black (e.g., #020617 / #050816).

Cards/panels: slightly lighter zinc (e.g., #0b1120, #111827).

Accents

Primary accent: yellow-orange (something like #fbbf24 or #facc15) for primary buttons, key metrics, and focus states.

Secondary accent: desaturated orange (#f97316) for warnings or “live” states.

Text

High-contrast off-white for primary text, muted slate/gray for secondary text.

Use a modern, slightly condensed sans-serif (e.g., Inter/Space Grotesk if available) with tight line heights for a “console” feel.

Effects & motion

Subtle glows around primary accents (very soft, low opacity).

Very soft, broad shadows on cards (no heavy drop shadows).

Micro-interactions on hover: light scale (+1–2%), border/outline accent, or slight background shift.

Layout & information architecture

Design a three-zone layout with a persistent top bar:

Top bar (global shell)

Left: WAC logo + “Walk Console” or “Walk Report” title + short one-line subheading (“Clip your physical world into AI-ready reports”).

Center/right:

Environment/status pill (e.g., “Connected to WAC-01 • Live”).

User avatar / settings.

A compact, global Command/AI input (“Ask WAC to summarize this walk…”) that we can wire later.

Main content split (2-column layout on desktop)

Left column: “Walk Data” / asset explorer

Right column: “Report Builder” / PDF builder

On smaller screens, stack these with the builder prioritized.

Bottom section: “Created Reports”

Full-width strip at the bottom with a slim card list of previously generated PDFs.

Use responsive design and fluid widths so this feels good from 1280px up to ultrawide.

Left column: Walk Data (world-class asset explorer)

Transform the current basic file grid into a rich asset explorer:

At the top of the left column, add:

Section title: “Walk Data” with a small “WAC Feed” label.

Small text showing count and last sync time, e.g., “24 images • Synced 2 min ago.”

Actions row:

Upload button (accent style)

Import from WAC Device ghost button

Filters icon button

Below, add a tool bar:

Search field (“Filter by tag, filename, or note”)

Quick filter chips: “All”, “Flagged”, “AI tagged hazards”, “Recently added”.

A view toggle (grid vs list).

Thumbnails/cards:

Use a tight grid of cards with:

Large thumbnail.

A small tag strip at the top-left that can show semantics like Hazard, Equipment, Location.

Metadata row: time since captured, file size, optional AI note icon.

On hover:

Slight scale up, highlight border with yellow-orange accent.

Show quick actions: Add to Builder, Preview, Tag.

Add an image preview side panel:

When a user clicks an image, open a right-side or modal preview with:

Large image, zoom controls.

Editable title/notes.

AI summary placeholder (“WAC insight: …”).

Button: “Send to PDF Builder” (primary accent).

This makes the Walk Data side feel like a mission feed, not just a static file list.

Right column: PDF / Report Builder (immersive canvas)

Replace the basic dropzone with a structured builder that feels like a control surface:

Section header:

Title: “Report Builder”.

Subtext: “Drag images from Walk Data or click to add. Arrange, annotate, and generate a WAC report.”

Right-aligned controls:

Clear Builder ghost button.

Generate Report primary button (accent background, rounded, with subtle glow).

Builder surface:

Create a large central card with a dashed border and subtle animated border glow to indicate drop area.

Inside, show:

Empty state illustration: abstract lines/frames (no cheesy stock art) and copy like “Drop images here to start composing your report.”

Once there are items, switch to a reorderable list or grid of “report pages”:

Each page card shows the thumbnail + page number and a tiny “Add note” affordance.

Users can drag to reorder.

Each card has quick actions: “Annotate”, “Remove”.

Right-side mini panel (if space allows) for Report meta:

Fields for: Report title, location, date/time, crew names.

Dropdowns for template type (e.g., “Standard Walk”, “Punchlist”, “Safety Audit”).

A summary chip area reserved for AI later: “WAC will generate a summary based on the selected images.”

States:

When generating, show a progress bar at the top of the builder card (“Compiling WAC Report… 72%”).

Use subtle motion: shimmering progress bar, rotating subtle icon.

Bottom section: Created PDFs / Reports

Upgrade the “Created PDFs” area into a history strip:

Section header: “Created Reports”.

Show a horizontal scroll row of compact cards, each with:

Report title.

Timestamp.

Count of included images.

Status badge (e.g., “Generated”, “Shared”, “Reopened”).

Action icons: Download, Open, Share.

Optionally show a small WAC icon indicating which physical device the report came from.

UX details and interaction polish

Implement these interaction patterns:

Drag and drop from the Walk Data grid into the Builder, with visual feedback:

Dropped items briefly glow in accent color.

A small toast confirming “Added 3 images to Report Builder”.

Keyboard shortcuts (wire basic ones):

Cmd/Ctrl + A: select all visible images in Walk Data.

Cmd/Ctrl + Enter: generate report when in builder.

Esc: close image preview.

Empty & loading states:

For Walk Data: show copy like “No images yet. Connect a WAC device or upload files to begin.”

For Created Reports: “You haven’t generated any reports yet. Build your first WAC report to see it here.”

Responsiveness:

On tablet/small screens, stack columns:

First: Walk Data

Second: Report Builder

Ensure drag-and-drop still works or provide explicit “Add to Builder” buttons.

Implementation instructions

Refactor the existing code into clear, reusable components such as:

AppShell (top bar + layout)

WalkDataPanel

AssetGrid / AssetCard

ReportBuilderPanel

ReportPageCard

CreatedReportsStrip

ImagePreviewModal

Use Tailwind utility classes to implement the color system, spacing, and typography described above.

Preserve and wire existing functionality (uploading images, listing images, building a PDF, clearing, generating, listing created PDFs), but wrap it in this new design.

The final result should feel like a high-end operations console for field intelligence, not a basic file uploader. Optimize for clarity, speed of use, and a sense that the user is operating a powerful system that turns raw field imagery into structured, AI-ready reports.

Build this entire redesigned UI in React + TypeScript + Tailwind, replacing the current UI while keeping the existing app logic intact.
